# Moksha
__Moksha__ is an extensible, customizable CLI (written with a __Python 3__ and __ncurses__ backend) that aims to embed the user's redundant, fleeting and high-dimensional mental-processes into a single hierarchical and archival data-structure. _In other words, it's a todo/calendar/journaling/note-taking/organizer for your terminal._

## Key Concepts
#### Tree
Your data is contained in a single, infinitely hierarchichal tree. The nodes of the tree are called branches - different branches allow different kinds of data-input and structure, and also support different display options. Collections of branches can be organized into groups, a higher-level attribute of the tree structure. There is no right or wrong way to use these building blocks - there are many possibilities.
