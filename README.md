# Moksha
__Moksha__ is an extensible, customizable CLI (written with a __Python 3__ and __ncurses__ backend) that aims to embed the user's redundant, fleeting and high-dimensional mental-processes into a single hierarchical and archival data-structure. _In other words, it's a todo/calendar/journaling/note-taking/organizer for your terminal._
